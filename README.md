# Challenge Ten: My Team, Team Portfolio Generator ![MIT badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
### updated For this challenge, I created a Team Portfolio Webpage Generator. My Team prompts the team manager to enter their name, employee ID number, email, and office number. The manager is then given the option to add an engineer, an intern, or to finish building their portfolio. If they choose to add an employee, they are prompted to enter information about that employee. When they are done building their portfolio, an HTML file titled "myteam" is generated. The generated HTML file can be found in the dist folder. An example of the generated HTML file can be found in the dist folder on this GitHub repository. There is no link to a deployed application because this application runs through the command-line.

## Installation
### Access the code via GitHub. Fork, clone, or download the code. This application only works using node.js and requires the installation of the Inquirer package, which can be found here: [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and the installation of the Jest package, which can be found here: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

## Usage
### This application is to be used to generate a webpage that displays a manager's team's basic information. 

### This video shows the functionality of the application:

## Credits 
### I used what I learned in the BootCamp Spot modules and BootCamp classes to create this scheduler. I especially used what I learned about inquirer and generating HTML in module 9 and what I learned about tests in module 10. I used the inquirer package for this application: [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#questions). I referred to the inquirer documentation frequently: [Inquirer Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#methods) and used this blog post to better understand Inquirer: [Blog post](https://pakstech.com/blog/inquirer-js/). I used this Slack Overflow example to better understand how to use "when" in an Inquirer question prompt: [Slack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56412516/conditional-prompt-rendering-in-inquirer). I also used Jest for this application: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started). I used Bootstrap for styling the generated My Team HTML, and specifically used this site to understand Bootstrap card styles: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/ ). 

## Tests
### To run tests on this application, you must have Jest installed. Then, you can begin tests by entering "npm start test" in the command line. The video linked above also demonstrates how to run testsnpm st.
